\section{Introduction}
This is a technical specification document for the Data Science (DS) and Machine Learning (ML) 
module run by Greg Doyle. As a part of the module, we, the students, are required to 
create this document to plan the various machine learning and data science projects 
that we will be working on throughout the first semester. By the end of the semester
we are expected to have completed all the projects defined in this document and then
present them to the class. This document will be used as a reference throughout the
semester to ensure that we are on track to complete the projects on time.

\subsection{Sea Level Prediction}

Using a dataset of sea levels over the years we can use a polynomial regression algorithm to predict future sea levels.
\\\textbf{ML Model:} Polynomial Regression
\\\textbf{Dataset:} \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkhandekar/global-sea-level-1993-2021}{Kaggle: global-sea-level-1993-2021, kkhandekar}
